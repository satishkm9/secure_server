Orion was our first project - an adventurous and boundary-pushing platformer that is a three-time winner of the Nebula Game
of the Year Awards, Orion was praised by its creators as hailing a new era of platformers. Combining the classic 2D platformer
style with 3D graphics and a 4D megamind approach, it's a little-understood gem that will truly stand the test of time.
